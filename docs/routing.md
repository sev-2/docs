# Routing

All routings are automatically generated by controllers.
You can define a routing on a controller.
Here is the example of hello controller.

::: code-group

```go [internals/controllers/hello.go]
import "github.com/sev-2/raiden"

package controllers

type HelloWorldController struct {
    raiden.ControllerBase
    Http    string `path:"/hello/{name}" type:"custom"` // [!code highlight]
    Payload *HelloWorldRequest
    Result  HelloWorldResponse
}
```
:::

As you can see, the routing are defined on `path:"/hello/{name}"`.
By runing `raiden generate`, that route will auto-generate to `router` directory.
